## Overview
vgg_image_trash_classifier is a deep learning project that uses the VGG16 model to classify images of trash into categories, such as:

- Plastic
- Paper
- Cardboard
- Glass Bottles
- Cans

This project aims to help waste management by providing accurate automatic classification based on a given image.

## Features
**Pretrained model**: Using VGG16 with transfer learning.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Parameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Flask Integration**: Deploy models using Flask-based applications.

**Docker Support**: Applications can run in Docker containers

## Getting Started
